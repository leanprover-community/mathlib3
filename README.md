[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/leanprover/mathlib.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/leanprover/mathlib)

Lean standard library

Besides [Lean's general documentation](https://leanprover.github.io/documentation/), the documentation of mathlib consists of:

- A [guide](docs/elan.md) on installing Lean and mathlib with elan.
- A description of [currently covered theories](docs/theories.md),
  as well as an [overview](docs/mathlib-overview.md) for mathematicians.
- A description of [tactics](docs/tactics.md) introduced in mathlib,
  and available [hole commands](docs/holes.md).
- An explanation of [naming conventions](docs/naming.md) that is useful
  to find or contribute definitions and lemmas.
- A [style guide](docs/style.md) for contributors
- An outline of [how to contribute](docs/howto-contribute.md) to mathlib.
- A tentative list of [work in progress](docs/wip.md) to make sure
  efforts are not duplicated without collaboration.

This repository also contains [extra Lean documentation](docs/extras.md)
not specific to mathlib.
