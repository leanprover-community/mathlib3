  abstract      = {The ring of Witt vectors W R over a base ring R is an
                  important tool in algebraic number theory and lies at the
                  foundations of modern p-adic Hodge theory. W R has the
                  interesting property that it constructs a ring of
                  characteristic 0 out of a ring of characteristic p &gt; 1,
                  and it can be used more specifically to construct from a
                  finite field containing ℤ/pℤ the corresponding
                  unramified field extension of the p-adic numbers ℚp
                  (which is unique up to isomorphism). We formalize the
                  notion of a Witt vector in the Lean proof assistant, along
                  with the corresponding ring operations and other algebraic
                  structure. We prove in Lean that, for prime p, the ring of
                  Witt vectors over ℤ/pℤ is isomorphic to the ring of
                  p-adic integers ℤp. In the process we develop idioms to
                  cleanly handle calculations of identities between
                  operations on the ring of Witt vectors. These calculations
                  are intractable with a naive approach, and require a proof
                  technique that is usually skimmed over in the informal
                  literature. Our proofs resemble the informal arguments
                  while being fully rigorous.},
