/-! Hint 1:
`yoneda` is set up so that `(yoneda.obj X).obj (op Y) = (Y ⟶ X)`
(we need to write `op Y` to explicitly move `Y` to the opposite category).

/-! Hint 2:
If you have a natural isomorphism `α : F ≅ G`, you can access
* the forward natural transformation as `α.hom`
* the backwards natural transformation as `α.inv`
* the component at `X`, as an isomorphism `F.obj X ≅ G.obj X` as `α.app X`.
