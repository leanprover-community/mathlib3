# Mathlib work in progress

The following lists current ongoing effort to extend mathlib. Help is
always welcome.

* [Kenny Lau](https://github.com/kckennylau) is working on
  [commutative algebra](https://github.com/leanprover/mathlib/pull/37), with a view toward algrebraic geometry.

* [Scott Morrison](https://github.com/semorrison) is working
  on merging his category
  theory ([part 1](https://github.com/semorrison/lean-category-theory-pr), [part 2](https://github.com/semorrison/lean-category-theory), [part 3](https://github.com/semorrison/lean-monoidal-categories))) into
  mathlib.

* [Reid Barton](https://github.com/rwbarton) is working on [homotopy theory](https://github.com/rwbarton/lean-homotopy-theory).  

* [Chris Hughes](https://github.com/dorhinj) is working on the
  [exponential function](https://github.com/dorhinj/mathlib)

* [Patrick Massot](https://github.com/PatrickMassot) is working on
  [calculus](https://github.com/PatrickMassot/lean-differential-topology)
  with a view toward differential topology.

* [Kevin Buzzard](https://github.com/kbuzzard) is working on [sheaf
  theory](https://github.com/kbuzzard/xena/blob/master/xenalib/scheme.lean)
  with a view toward algebraic geometry.

* [Sean Leather](https://github.com/spl) is working on a
  [finite map](https://github.com/spl/lean-finmap) for mathlib.
