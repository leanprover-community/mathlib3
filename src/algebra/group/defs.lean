# Typeclasses for (semi)groups and monoids

In this file we define typeclasses for algebraic structures with one binary operation.
The classes are named `(add_)?(comm_)?(semigroup|monoid|group)`, where `add_` means that
the class uses additive notation and `comm_` means that the class assumes that the binary
operation is commutative.

The file does not contain any lemmas except for

* axioms of typeclasses restated in the root namespace;
* lemmas required for instances.

For basic lemmas about these classes see `algebra.group.basic`.

/- Additive "sister" structures.
   Example, add_semigroup mirrors semigroup.
   These structures exist just to help automation.
   In an alternative design, we could have the binary operation as an
   extra argument for semigroup, monoid, group, etc. However, the lemmas
   would be hard to index since they would not contain any constant.
   For example, mul_assoc would be

   lemma mul_assoc {α : Type u} {op : α → α → α} [semigroup α op] :
                   ∀ a b c : α, op (op a b) c = op a (op b c) :=
    semigroup.mul_assoc

   The simplifier cannot effectively use this lemma since the pattern for
   the left-hand-side would be

        ?op (?op ?a ?b) ?c

   Remark: we use a tactic for transporting theorems from the multiplicative fragment
   to the additive one.

/-- Suppose that one can put two mathematical structures on a type, a rich one `R` and a poor one
`P`, and that one can deduce the poor structure from the rich structure through a map `F` (called a
forgetful functor) (think `R = metric_space` and `P = topological_space`). A possible
implementation would be to have a type class `rich` containing a field `R`, a type class `poor`
containing a field `P`, and an instance from `rich` to `poor`. However, this creates diamond
problems, and a better approach is to let `rich` extend `poor` and have a field saying that
`F R = P`.

To illustrate this, consider the pair `metric_space` / `topological_space`. Consider the topology
on a product of two metric spaces. With the first approach, it could be obtained by going first from
each metric space to its topology, and then taking the product topology. But it could also be
obtained by considering the product metric space (with its sup distance) and then the topology
coming from this distance. These would be the same topology, but not definitionally, which means
that from the point of view of Lean's kernel, there would be two different `topological_space`
instances on the product. This is not compatible with the way instances are designed and used:
there should be at most one instance of a kind on each type. This approach has created an instance
diamond that does not commute definitionally.

The second approach solves this issue. Now, a metric space contains both a distance, a topology, and
a proof that the topology coincides with the one coming from the distance. When one defines the
product of two metric spaces, one uses the sup distance and the product topology, and one has to
give the proof that the sup distance induces the product topology. Following both sides of the
instance diamond then gives rise (definitionally) to the product topology on the product space.

Another approach would be to have the rich type class take the poor type class as an instance
parameter. It would solve the diamond problem, but it would lead to a blow up of the number
of type classes one would need to declare to work with complicated classes, say a real inner
product space, and would create exponential complexity when working with products of
such complicated spaces, that are avoided by bundling things carefully as above.

Note that this description of this specific case of the product of metric spaces is oversimplified
compared to mathlib, as there is an intermediate typeclass between `metric_space` and
`topological_space` called `uniform_space`. The above scheme is used at both levels, embedding a
topology in the uniform space structure, and a uniform structure in the metric space structure.

Note also that, when `P` is a proposition, there is no such issue as any two proofs of `P` are
definitionally equivalent in Lean.

To avoid boilerplate, there are some designs that can automatically fill the poor fields when
creating a rich structure if one doesn't want to do something special about them. For instance,
in the definition of metric spaces, default tactics fill the uniform space fields if they are
not given explicitly. One can also have a helper function creating the rich structure from a
structure with fewer fields, where the helper function fills the remaining fields. See for instance
`uniform_space.of_core` or `real_inner_product.of_core`.

### Design note on `add_monoid` and `monoid`

An `add_monoid` has a natural `ℕ`-action, defined by `n • a = a + ... + a`, that we want to declare
as an instance as it makes it possible to use the language of linear algebra. However, there are
often other natural `ℕ`-actions. For instance, for any semiring `R`, the space of polynomials
`polynomial R` has a natural `R`-action defined by multiplication on the coefficients. This means
that `polynomial ℕ` would have two natural `ℕ`-actions, which are equal but not defeq. The same
goes for linear maps, tensor products, and so on (and even for `ℕ` itself).

To solve this issue, we embed an `ℕ`-action in the definition of an `add_monoid` (which is by
default equal to the naive action `a + ... + a`, but can be adjusted when needed), and declare
a `has_scalar ℕ α` instance using this action. See Note [forgetful inheritance] for more
explanations on this pattern.

For example, when we define `polynomial R`, then we declare the `ℕ`-action to be by multiplication
on each coefficient (using the `ℕ`-action on `R` that comes from the fact that `R` is
an `add_monoid`). In this way, the two natural `has_scalar ℕ (polynomial ℕ)` instances are defeq.

The tactic `to_additive` transfers definitions and results from multiplicative monoids to additive
monoids. To work, it has to map fields to fields. This means that we should also add corresponding
fields to the multiplicative structure `monoid`, which could solve defeq problems for powers if
needed. These problems do not come up in practice, so most of the time we will not need to adjust
the `npow` field when defining multiplicative objects.

Nice notation and a basic theory for the power function on monoids and the `ℕ`-action on additive
monoids are built in the file `algebra.group_power.basic`. For now, we only register the most basic
properties that we need right away.

In the definition, we use `n.succ` instead of `n + 1` in the `nsmul_succ'` and `npow_succ'` fields
to make sure that `to_additive` is not confused (otherwise, it would try to convert `1 : ℕ`
to `0 : ℕ`).

This is the immediate common ancestor of `group` and `group_with_zero`,
in order to deduplicate the name `div_eq_mul_inv`.
The default for `div` is such that `a / b = a * b⁻¹` holds by definition.

Adding `div` as a field rather than defining `a / b := a * b⁻¹` allows us to
avoid certain classes of unification failures, for example:
Let `foo X` be a type with a `∀ X, has_div (foo X)` instance but no
`∀ X, has_inv (foo X)`, e.g. when `foo X` is a `euclidean_domain`. Suppose we
also have an instance `∀ X [cromulent X], group_with_zero (foo X)`. Then the
`(/)` coming from `group_with_zero_has_div` cannot be definitionally equal to
the `(/)` coming from `foo.has_div`.

In the same way, adding a `gpow` field makes it possible to avoid definitional failures
in diamonds. See the definition of `monoid` and Note [forgetful inheritance] for more
explanations on this.

/-- A `sub_neg_monoid` is an `add_monoid` with unary `-` and binary `-` operations
satisfying `sub_eq_add_neg : ∀ a b, a - b = a + -b`.

The default for `sub` is such that `a - b = a + -b` holds by definition.

Adding `sub` as a field rather than defining `a - b := a + -b` allows us to
avoid certain classes of unification failures, for example:
Let `foo X` be a type with a `∀ X, has_sub (foo X)` instance but no
`∀ X, has_neg (foo X)`. Suppose we also have an instance
`∀ X [cromulent X], add_group (foo X)`. Then the `(-)` coming from
`add_group.has_sub` cannot be definitionally equal to the `(-)` coming from
`foo.has_sub`.

In the same way, adding a `gsmul` field makes it possible to avoid definitional failures
in diamonds. See the definition of `add_monoid` and Note [forgetful inheritance] for more
explanations on this.
