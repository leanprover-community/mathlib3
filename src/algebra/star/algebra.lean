# Star algebras

Introduces the notion of a star algebra over a star ring.

/--
A star algebra `A` over a star ring `R` is an algebra which is a star ring,
and the two star structures are compatible in the sense
`star (r • a) = star r • star a`.
-/
-- Note that we take `star_ring A` as a typeclass argument, rather than extending it,
-- to avoid having multiple definitions of the star operation.
