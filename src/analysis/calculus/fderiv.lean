# The Fréchet derivative

Let `E` and `F` be normed spaces, `f : E → F`, and `f' : E →L[𝕜] F` a
continuous 𝕜-linear map, where `𝕜` is a non-discrete normed field. Then

  `has_fderiv_within_at f f' s x`

says that `f` has derivative `f'` at `x`, where the domain of interest
is restricted to `s`. We also have

  `has_fderiv_at f f' x := has_fderiv_within_at f f' x univ`

Finally,

  `has_strict_fderiv_at f f' x`

means that `f : E → F` has derivative `f' : E →L[𝕜] F` in the sense of strict differentiability,
i.e., `f y - f z - f'(y - z) = o(y - z)` as `y, z → x`. This notion is used in the inverse
function theorem, and is defined here only to avoid proving theorems like
`is_bounded_bilinear_map.has_fderiv_at` twice: first for `has_fderiv_at`, then for
`has_strict_fderiv_at`.

## Main results

In addition to the definition and basic properties of the derivative, this file contains the
usual formulas (and existence assertions) for the derivative of
* constants
* the identity
* bounded linear maps
* bounded bilinear maps
* sum of two functions
* sum of finitely many functions
* multiplication of a function by a scalar constant
* negative of a function
* subtraction of two functions
* multiplication of a function by a scalar function
* multiplication of two scalar functions
* composition of functions (the chain rule)
* inverse function (assuming that it exists; the inverse function theorem is in `inverse.lean`)

For most binary operations we also define `const_op` and `op_const` theorems for the cases when
the first or second argument is a constant. This makes writing chains of `has_deriv_at`'s easier,
and they more frequently lead to the desired result.

One can also interpret the derivative of a function `f : 𝕜 → E` as an element of `E` (by identifying
a linear function from `𝕜` to `E` with its value at `1`). Results on the Fréchet derivative are
translated to this more elementary point of view on the derivative in the file `deriv.lean`. The
derivative of polynomials is handled there, as it is naturally one-dimensional.

The simplifier is set up to prove automatically that some functions are differentiable, or
differentiable at a point (but not differentiable on a set or within a set at a point, as checking
automatically that the good domains are mapped one to the other when using composition is not
something the simplifier can easily do). This means that one can write
`example (x : ℝ) : differentiable ℝ (λ x, sin (exp (3 + x^2)) - 5 * cos x) := by simp`.
If there are divisions, one needs to supply to the simplifier proofs that the denominators do
not vanish, as in
```lean
example (x : ℝ) (h : 1 + sin x ≠ 0) : differentiable_at ℝ (λ x, exp x / (1 + sin x)) x :=
by simp [h]
```
Of course, these examples only work once `exp`, `cos` and `sin` have been shown to be
differentiable, in `analysis.special_functions.trigonometric`.

The simplifier is not set up to compute the Fréchet derivative of maps (as these are in general
complicated multidimensional linear maps), but it will compute one-dimensional derivatives,
see `deriv.lean`.

## Implementation details

The derivative is defined in terms of the `is_o` relation, but also
characterized in terms of the `tendsto` relation.

We also introduce predicates `differentiable_within_at 𝕜 f s x` (where `𝕜` is the base field,
`f` the function to be differentiated, `x` the point at which the derivative is asserted to exist,
and `s` the set along which the derivative is defined), as well as `differentiable_at 𝕜 f x`,
`differentiable_on 𝕜 f s` and `differentiable 𝕜 f` to express the existence of a derivative.

To be able to compute with derivatives, we write `fderiv_within 𝕜 f s x` and `fderiv 𝕜 f x`
for some choice of a derivative if it exists, and the zero function otherwise. This choice only
behaves well along sets for which the derivative is unique, i.e., those for which the tangent
directions span a dense subset of the whole space. The predicates `unique_diff_within_at s x` and
`unique_diff_on s`, defined in `tangent_cone.lean` express this property. We prove that indeed
they imply the uniqueness of the derivative. This is satisfied for open subsets, and in particular
for `univ`. This uniqueness only holds when the field is non-discrete, which we request at the very
beginning: otherwise, a derivative can be defined, but it has no interesting properties whatsoever.

To make sure that the simplifier can prove automatically that functions are differentiable, we tag
many lemmas with the `simp` attribute, for instance those saying that the sum of differentiable
functions is differentiable, as well as their product, their cartesian product, and so on. A notable
exception is the chain rule: we do not mark as a simp lemma the fact that, if `f` and `g` are
differentiable, then their composition also is: `simp` would always be able to match this lemma,
by taking `f` or `g` to be the identity. Instead, for every reasonable function (say, `exp`),
we add a lemma that if `f` is differentiable then so is `(λ x, exp (f x))`. This means adding
some boilerplate lemmas, but these can also be useful in their own right.

Tests for this ability of the simplifier (with more examples) are provided in
`tests/differentiable.lean`.

We prove that the definitions `unique_diff_within_at` and `unique_diff_on` indeed imply the

/-- If a function f has a derivative f' at x, a rescaled version of f around x converges to f',
i.e., `n (f (x + (1/n) v) - f x)` converges to `f' v`. More generally, if `c n` tends to infinity
and `c n * d n` tends to `v`, then `c n * (f (x + d n) - f x)` tends to `f' v`. This lemma expresses
this fact, for functions having a derivative within a set. Its specific formulation is useful for
tangent cone related discussions. -/

### Derivatives of functions `f : E → Π i, F' i`

In this section we formulate `has_*fderiv*_pi` theorems as `iff`s, and provide two versions of each
theorem:

* the version without `'` deals with `φ : Π i, E → F' i` and `φ' : Π i, E →L[𝕜] F' i`
  and is designed to deduce differentiability of `λ x i, φ i x` from differentiability
  of each `φ i`;
* the version with `'` deals with `Φ : E → Π i, F' i` and `Φ' : E →L[𝕜] Π i, F' i`
  and is designed to deduce differentiability of the components `λ x, Φ x i` from
  differentiability of `Φ`.

### The set of continuous linear equivalences between two Banach spaces is open

In this section we establish that the set of continuous linear equivalences between two Banach
spaces is an open subset of the space of linear maps between them.  These facts are placed here
because the proof uses `is_bounded_bilinear_map.continuous_left`, proved just above as a consequence
of its differentiability.

/-! ### Derivative of the product of a scalar-valued function and a vector-valued function

If `c` is a differentiable scalar-valued function and `f` is a differentiable vector-valued
function, then `λ x, c x • f x` is differentiable as well. Lemmas in this section works for
function `c` taking values in the base field, as well as in a normed algebra over the base
field: e.g., they work for `c : E → ℂ` and `f : E → F` provided that `F` is a complex
normed vector space.

### Restricting from `ℂ` to `ℝ`, or generally from `𝕜'` to `𝕜`

If a function is differentiable over `ℂ`, then it is differentiable over `ℝ`. In this paragraph,
we give variants of this statement, in the general situation where `ℂ` and `ℝ` are replaced
respectively by `𝕜'` and `𝕜` where `𝕜'` is a normed algebra over `𝕜`.
