# Higher differentiability

A function is `C^1` on a domain if it is differentiable there, and its derivative is continuous.
By induction, it is `C^n` if it is `C^{n-1}` and its (n-1)-th derivative is `C^1` there or,
equivalently, if it is `C^1` and its derivative is `C^{n-1}`.
Finally, it is `C^∞` if it is `C^n` for all n.

We formalize these notions by defining iteratively the `n+1`-th derivative of a function as the
derivative of the `n`-th derivative. It is called `iterated_fderiv 𝕜 n f x` where `𝕜` is the
field, `n` is the number of iterations, `f` is the function and `x` is the point, and it is given
as an `n`-multilinear map. We also define a version `iterated_fderiv_within` relative to a domain,
as well as predicates `times_cont_diff_within_at`, `times_cont_diff_at`, `times_cont_diff_on` and
`times_cont_diff` saying that the function is `C^n` within a set at a point, at a point, on a set
and on the whole space respectively.

To avoid the issue of choice when choosing a derivative in sets where the derivative is not
necessarily unique, `times_cont_diff_on` is not defined directly in terms of the
regularity of the specific choice `iterated_fderiv_within 𝕜 n f s` inside `s`, but in terms of the
existence of a nice sequence of derivatives, expressed with a predicate
`has_ftaylor_series_up_to_on`.

We prove basic properties of these notions.

## Main definitions and results
Let `f : E → F` be a map between normed vector spaces over a nondiscrete normed field `𝕜`.

* `has_ftaylor_series_up_to n f p`: expresses that the formal multilinear series `p` is a sequence
  of iterated derivatives of `f`, up to the `n`-th term (where `n` is a natural number or `∞`).
* `has_ftaylor_series_up_to_on n f p s`: same thing, but inside a set `s`. The notion of derivative
  is now taken inside `s`. In particular, derivatives don't have to be unique.
* `times_cont_diff 𝕜 n f`: expresses that `f` is `C^n`, i.e., it admits a Taylor series up to
  rank `n`.
* `times_cont_diff_on 𝕜 n f s`: expresses that `f` is `C^n` in `s`.
* `times_cont_diff_at 𝕜 n f x`: expresses that `f` is `C^n` around `x`.
* `times_cont_diff_within_at 𝕜 n f s x`: expresses that `f` is `C^n` around `x` within the set `s`.
* `iterated_fderiv_within 𝕜 n f s x` is an `n`-th derivative of `f` over the field `𝕜` on the
  set `s` at the point `x`. It is a continuous multilinear map from `E^n` to `F`, defined as a
  derivative within `s` of `iterated_fderiv_within 𝕜 (n-1) f s` if one exists, and `0` otherwise.
* `iterated_fderiv 𝕜 n f x` is the `n`-th derivative of `f` over the field `𝕜` at the point `x`.
  It is a continuous multilinear map from `E^n` to `F`, defined as a derivative of
  `iterated_fderiv 𝕜 (n-1) f` if one exists, and `0` otherwise.

In sets of unique differentiability, `times_cont_diff_on 𝕜 n f s` can be expressed in terms of the
properties of `iterated_fderiv_within 𝕜 m f s` for `m ≤ n`. In the whole space,
`times_cont_diff 𝕜 n f` can be expressed in terms of the properties of `iterated_fderiv 𝕜 m f`
for `m ≤ n`.

We also prove that the usual operations (addition, multiplication, difference, composition, and
so on) preserve `C^n` functions.

## Implementation notes

The definitions in this file are designed to work on any field `𝕜`. They are sometimes slightly more
complicated than the naive definitions one would guess from the intuition over the real or complex
numbers, but they are designed to circumvent the lack of gluing properties and partitions of unity
in general. In the usual situations, they coincide with the usual definitions.

### Definition of `C^n` functions in domains

One could define `C^n` functions in a domain `s` by fixing an arbitrary choice of derivatives (this
is what we do with `iterated_fderiv_within`) and requiring that all these derivatives up to `n` are
continuous. If the derivative is not unique, this could lead to strange behavior like two `C^n`
functions `f` and `g` on `s` whose sum is not `C^n`. A better definition is thus to say that a
function is `C^n` inside `s` if it admits a sequence of derivatives up to `n` inside `s`.

This definition still has the problem that a function which is locally `C^n` would not need to
be `C^n`, as different choices of sequences of derivatives around different points might possibly
not be glued together to give a globally defined sequence of derivatives. (Note that this issue
can not happen over reals, thanks to partition of unity, but the behavior over a general field is
not so clear, and we want a definition for general fields). Also, there are locality
problems for the order parameter: one could image a function which, for each `n`, has a nice
sequence of derivatives up to order `n`, but they do not coincide for varying `n` and can therefore
not be  glued to give rise to an infinite sequence of derivatives. This would give a function
which is `C^n` for all `n`, but not `C^∞`. We solve this issue by putting locality conditions
in space and order in our definition of `times_cont_diff_within_at` and `times_cont_diff_on`.
The resulting definition is slightly more complicated to work with (in fact not so much), but it
gives rise to completely satisfactory theorems.

For instance, with this definition, a real function which is `C^m` (but not better) on `(-1/m, 1/m)`
for each natural `m` is by definition `C^∞` at `0`.

There is another issue with the definition of `times_cont_diff_within_at 𝕜 n f s x`. We can
require the existence and good behavior of derivatives up to order `n` on a neighborhood of `x`
within `s`. However, this does not imply continuity or differentiability within `s` of the function
at `x` when `x` does not belong to `s`. Therefore, we require such existence and good behavior on
a neighborhood of `x` within `s ∪ {x}` (which appears as `insert x s` in this file).

### Side of the composition, and universe issues

With a naïve direct definition, the `n`-th derivative of a function belongs to the space
`E →L[𝕜] (E →L[𝕜] (E ... F)...)))` where there are n iterations of `E →L[𝕜]`. This space
may also be seen as the space of continuous multilinear functions on `n` copies of `E` with
values in `F`, by uncurrying. This is the point of view that is usually adopted in textbooks,
and that we also use. This means that the definition and the first proofs are slightly involved,
as one has to keep track of the uncurrying operation. The uncurrying can be done from the
left or from the right, amounting to defining the `n+1`-th derivative either as the derivative of
the `n`-th derivative, or as the `n`-th derivative of the derivative.
For proofs, it would be more convenient to use the latter approach (from the right),
as it means to prove things at the `n+1`-th step we only need to understand well enough the
derivative in `E →L[𝕜] F` (contrary to the approach from the left, where one would need to know
enough on the `n`-th derivative to deduce things on the `n+1`-th derivative).

However, the definition from the right leads to a universe polymorphism problem: if we define
`iterated_fderiv 𝕜 (n + 1) f x = iterated_fderiv 𝕜 n (fderiv 𝕜 f) x` by induction, we need to
generalize over all spaces (as `f` and `fderiv 𝕜 f` don't take values in the same space). It is
only possible to generalize over all spaces in some fixed universe in an inductive definition.
For `f : E → F`, then `fderiv 𝕜 f` is a map `E → (E →L[𝕜] F)`. Therefore, the definition will only
work if `F` and `E →L[𝕜] F` are in the same universe.

This issue does not appear with the definition from the left, where one does not need to generalize
over all spaces. Therefore, we use the definition from the left. This means some proofs later on
become a little bit more complicated: to prove that a function is `C^n`, the most efficient approach
is to exhibit a formula for its `n`-th derivative and prove it is continuous (contrary to the
inductive approach where one would prove smoothness statements without giving a formula for the
derivative). In the end, this approach is still satisfactory as it is good to have formulas for the
iterated derivatives in various constructions.

One point where we depart from this explicit approach is in the proof of smoothness of a
composition: there is a formula for the `n`-th derivative of a composition (Faà di Bruno's formula),
but it is very complicated and barely usable, while the inductive proof is very simple. Thus, we
give the inductive proof. As explained above, it works by generalizing over the target space, hence
it only works well if all spaces belong to the same universe. To get the general version, we lift
things to a common universe using a trick.

### Variables management

The textbook definitions and proofs use various identifications and abuse of notations, for instance
when saying that the natural space in which the derivative lives, i.e.,
`E →L[𝕜] (E →L[𝕜] ( ... →L[𝕜] F))`, is the same as a space of multilinear maps. When doing things
formally, we need to provide explicit maps for these identifications, and chase some diagrams to see
everything is compatible with the identifications. In particular, one needs to check that taking the
derivative and then doing the identification, or first doing the identification and then taking the
derivative, gives the same result. The key point for this is that taking the derivative commutes
with continuous linear equivalences. Therefore, we need to implement all our identifications with
continuous linear equivs.

## Notations

We use the notation `E [×n]→L[𝕜] F` for the space of continuous multilinear maps on `E^n` with
values in `F`. This is the space in which the `n`-th derivative of a function from `E` to `F` lives.

In this file, we denote `⊤ : with_top ℕ` with `∞`.

### Composition of `C^n` functions

We show that the composition of `C^n` functions is `C^n`. One way to prove it would be to write
the `n`-th derivative of the composition (this is Faà di Bruno's formula) and check its continuity,
but this is very painful. Instead, we go for a simple inductive proof. Assume it is done for `n`.
Then, to check it for `n+1`, one needs to check that the derivative of `g ∘ f` is `C^n`, i.e.,
that `Dg(f x) ⬝ Df(x)` is `C^n`. The term `Dg (f x)` is the composition of two `C^n` functions, so
it is `C^n` by the inductive assumption. The term `Df(x)` is also `C^n`. Then, the matrix
multiplication is the application of a bilinear map (which is `C^∞`, and therefore `C^n`) to
`x ↦ (Dg(f x), Df x)`. As the composition of two `C^n` maps, it is again `C^n`, and we are done.

There is a subtlety in this argument: we apply the inductive assumption to functions on other Banach
spaces. In maths, one would say: prove by induction over `n` that, for all `C^n` maps between all
pairs of Banach spaces, their composition is `C^n`. In Lean, this is fine as long as the spaces
stay in the same universe. This is not the case in the above argument: if `E` lives in universe `u`
and `F` lives in universe `v`, then linear maps from `E` to `F` (to which the derivative of `f`
belongs) is in universe `max u v`. If one could quantify over finitely many universes, the above
proof would work fine, but this is not the case. One could still write the proof considering spaces
in any universe in `u, v, w, max u v, max v w, max u v w`, but it would be extremely tedious and
lead to a lot of duplication. Instead, we formulate the above proof when all spaces live in the same
universe (where everything is fine), and then we deduce the general result by lifting all our spaces
to a common universe. We use the trick that any space `H` is isomorphic through a continuous linear
equiv to `continuous_multilinear_map (λ (i : fin 0), E × F × G) H` to change the universe level,
and then argue that composing with such a linear equiv does not change the fact of being `C^n`,
which we have already proved previously.

### Restricting from `ℂ` to `ℝ`, or generally from `𝕜'` to `𝕜`

If a function is `n` times continuously differentiable over `ℂ`, then it is `n` times continuously
differentiable over `ℝ`. In this paragraph, we give variants of this statement, in the general
situation where `ℂ` and `ℝ` are replaced respectively by `𝕜'` and `𝕜` where `𝕜'` is a normed algebra
over `𝕜`.
