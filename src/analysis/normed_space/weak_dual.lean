# Weak dual of normed space

Let `E` be a normed space over a field `𝕜`. This file is concerned with properties of the weak-*
topology on the dual of `E`. By the dual, we mean either of the type synonyms
`normed_space.dual 𝕜 E` or `weak_dual 𝕜 E`, depending on whether it is viewed as equipped with its
usual operator norm topology or the weak-* topology.

It is shown that the canonical mapping `normed_space.dual 𝕜 E → weak_dual 𝕜 E` is continuous, and
as a consequence the weak-* topology is coarser than the topology obtained from the operator norm
(dual norm).

The file is a stub, some TODOs below.

## Main definitions

The main definitions concern the canonical mapping `dual 𝕜 E → weak_dual 𝕜 E`.

* `normed_space.dual.to_weak_dual` and `weak_dual.to_normed_dual`: Linear equivalences from
  `dual 𝕜 E` to `weak_dual 𝕜 E` and in the converse direction.
* `normed_space.dual.continuous_linear_map_to_weak_dual`: A continuous linear mapping from
  `dual 𝕜 E` to `weak_dual 𝕜 E` (same as `normed_space.dual.to_weak_dual` but different bundled
  data).

## Main results

The first main result concerns the comparison of the operator norm topology on `dual 𝕜 E` and the
weak-* topology on (its type synonym) `weak_dual 𝕜 E`:
* `dual_norm_topology_le_weak_dual_topology`: The weak-* topology on the dual of a normed space is
  coarser (not necessarily strictly) than the operator norm topology.

TODOs:
* Add that in finite dimensions, the weak-* topology and the dual norm topology coincide.
* Add that in infinite dimensions, the weak-* topology is strictly coarser than the dual norm
  topology.
* Add Banach-Alaoglu theorem (general version maybe in `topology.algebra.module.weak_dual`).
* Add metrizability of the dual unit ball (more generally bounded subsets) of `weak_dual 𝕜 E`
  under the assumption of separability of `E`. Sequential Banach-Alaoglu theorem would then follow
  from the general one.

## Notations

No new notation is introduced.

## Implementation notes

Weak-* topology is defined generally in the file `topology.algebra.module.weak_dual`.

When `E` is a normed space, the duals `dual 𝕜 E` and `weak_dual 𝕜 E` are type synonyms with
different topology instances.

### Weak star topology on duals of normed spaces
In this section, we prove properties about the weak-* topology on duals of normed spaces.
We prove in particular that the canonical mapping `dual 𝕜 E → weak_dual 𝕜 E` is continuous,
i.e., that the weak-* topology is coarser (not necessarily strictly) than the topology given
by the dual-norm (i.e. the operator-norm).
