# Differential objects in a category.

A differential object in a category with zero morphisms and a shift is
an object `X` equipped with
a morphism `d : X ⟶ X⟦1⟧`, such that `d^2 = 0`.

We build the category of differential objects, and some basic constructions
such as the forgetful functor, and zero morphisms and zero objects.
