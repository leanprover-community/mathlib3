# The category of graded objects

For any type `β`, a `β`-graded object over some category `C` is just
a function `β → C` into the objects of `C`.
We define the category structure on these.

We describe the `comap` functors obtained by precomposing with functions `β → γ`.

As a consequence a fixed element (e.g. `1`) in an additive group `β` provides a shift
functor on `β`-graded objects

When `C` has coproducts we construct the `total` functor `graded_object β C ⥤ C`,
show that it is faithful, and deduce that when `C` is concrete so is `graded_object β C`.

The `total` functor taking a graded object to the coproduct of its graded components is faithful.
To prove this, we need to know that the coprojections into the coproduct are monomorphisms,
which follows from the fact we have zero morphisms and decidable equality for the grading.
