# Constructions related to weakly initial objects

> THIS FILE IS SYNCHRONIZED WITH MATHLIB4.
> Any changes to this file require a corresponding PR to mathlib4.

This file gives constructions related to weakly initial objects, namely:
* If a category has small products and a small weakly initial set of objects, then it has a weakly
  initial object.
* If a category has wide equalizers and a weakly initial object, then it has an initial object.

These are primarily useful to show the General Adjoint Functor Theorem.

If `C` has (small) products and a small weakly initial set of objects, then it has a weakly initial
object.

If `C` has (small) wide equalizers and a weakly initial object, then it has an initial object.

The initial object is constructed as the wide equalizer of all endomorphisms on the given weakly
initial object.
