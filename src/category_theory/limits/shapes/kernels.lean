# Kernels and cokernels

In a category with zero morphisms, the kernel of a morphism `f : X ⟶ Y` is just the equalizer of `f`
and `0 : X ⟶ Y`. (Similarly the cokernel is the coequalizer.)

We don't yet prove much here, just provide
* `kernel : (X ⟶ Y) → C`
* `kernel.ι : kernel f ⟶ X`
* `kernel.condition : kernel.ι f ≫ f = 0` and
* `kernel.lift (k : W ⟶ X) (h : k ≫ f = 0) : W ⟶ kernel f` (as well as the dual versions)

## Future work
* TODO: images and coimages, and then abelian categories.
* TODO: connect this with existing working in the group theory and ring theory libraries.

## Implementation notes
As with the other special shapes in the limits library, all the definitions here are given as
`abbreviation`s of the general statements for limits, so all the `simp` lemmas and theorems about
general limits can be used.
