# Fundamental Theorem of Calculus

We prove various versions of the
[fundamental theorem of calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_theorem_of_calculus)
for interval integrals in `ℝ`.

Recall that its first version states that the function `(u, v) ↦ ∫ x in u..v, f x` has derivative
`(δu, δv) ↦ δv • f b - δu • f a` at `(a, b)` provided that `f` is continuous at `a` and `b`,
and its second version states that, if `f` has an integrable derivative on `[a, b]`, then
`∫ x in a..b, f' x = f b - f a`.

## Main statements

### FTC-1 for Lebesgue measure

We prove several versions of FTC-1, all in the `interval_integral` namespace. Many of them follow
the naming scheme `integral_has(_strict?)_(f?)deriv(_within?)_at(_of_tendsto_ae?)(_right|_left?)`.
They formulate FTC in terms of `has(_strict?)_(f?)deriv(_within?)_at`.
Let us explain the meaning of each part of the name:

* `_strict` means that the theorem is about strict differentiability;
* `f` means that the theorem is about differentiability in both endpoints; incompatible with
  `_right|_left`;
* `_within` means that the theorem is about one-sided derivatives, see below for details;
* `_of_tendsto_ae` means that instead of continuity the theorem assumes that `f` has a finite limit
  almost surely as `x` tends to `a` and/or `b`;
* `_right` or `_left` mean that the theorem is about differentiability in the right (resp., left)
  endpoint.

We also reformulate these theorems in terms of `(f?)deriv(_within?)`. These theorems are named
`(f?)deriv(_within?)_integral(_of_tendsto_ae?)(_right|_left?)` with the same meaning of parts of the
name.

### One-sided derivatives

Theorem `integral_has_fderiv_within_at_of_tendsto_ae` states that `(u, v) ↦ ∫ x in u..v, f x` has a
derivative `(δu, δv) ↦ δv • cb - δu • ca` within the set `s × t` at `(a, b)` provided that `f` tends
to `ca` (resp., `cb`) almost surely at `la` (resp., `lb`), where possible values of `s`, `t`, and
corresponding filters `la`, `lb` are given in the following table.

| `s`     | `la`     | `t`     | `lb`     |
| ------- | ----     | ---     | ----     |
| `Iic a` | `𝓝[≤] a` | `Iic b` | `𝓝[≤] b` |
| `Ici a` | `𝓝[>] a` | `Ici b` | `𝓝[>] b` |
| `{a}`   | `⊥`      | `{b}`   | `⊥`      |
| `univ`  | `𝓝 a`    | `univ`  | `𝓝 b`    |

We use a typeclass `FTC_filter` to make Lean automatically find `la`/`lb` based on `s`/`t`. This way
we can formulate one theorem instead of `16` (or `8` if we leave only non-trivial ones not covered
by `integral_has_deriv_within_at_of_tendsto_ae_(left|right)` and
`integral_has_fderiv_at_of_tendsto_ae`). Similarly,
`integral_has_deriv_within_at_of_tendsto_ae_right` works for both one-sided derivatives using the
same typeclass to find an appropriate filter.

### FTC for a locally finite measure

Before proving FTC for the Lebesgue measure, we prove a few statements that can be seen as FTC for
any measure. The most general of them,
`measure_integral_sub_integral_sub_linear_is_o_of_tendsto_ae`, states the following. Let `(la, la')`
be an `FTC_filter` pair of filters around `a` (i.e., `FTC_filter a la la'`) and let `(lb, lb')` be
an `FTC_filter` pair of filters around `b`. If `f` has finite limits `ca` and `cb` almost surely at
`la'` and `lb'`, respectively, then
`∫ x in va..vb, f x ∂μ - ∫ x in ua..ub, f x ∂μ = ∫ x in ub..vb, cb ∂μ - ∫ x in ua..va, ca ∂μ +
  o(‖∫ x in ua..va, (1:ℝ) ∂μ‖ + ‖∫ x in ub..vb, (1:ℝ) ∂μ‖)` as `ua` and `va` tend to `la` while
`ub` and `vb` tend to `lb`.

### FTC-2 and corollaries

We use FTC-1 to prove several versions of FTC-2 for the Lebesgue measure, using a similar naming
scheme as for the versions of FTC-1. They include:
* `interval_integral.integral_eq_sub_of_has_deriv_right_of_le` - most general version, for functions
  with a right derivative
* `interval_integral.integral_eq_sub_of_has_deriv_at'` - version for functions with a derivative on
  an open set
* `interval_integral.integral_deriv_eq_sub'` - version that is easiest to use when computing the
  integral of a specific function

We then derive additional integration techniques from FTC-2:
* `interval_integral.integral_mul_deriv_eq_deriv_mul` - integration by parts
* `interval_integral.integral_comp_mul_deriv''` - integration by substitution

Many applications of these theorems can be found in the file `analysis.special_functions.integrals`.

Note that the assumptions of FTC-2 are formulated in the form that `f'` is integrable. To use it in
a context with the stronger assumption that `f'` is continuous, one can use
`continuous_on.interval_integrable` or `continuous_on.integrable_on_Icc` or
`continuous_on.integrable_on_interval`.

### `FTC_filter` class

As explained above, many theorems in this file rely on the typeclass
`FTC_filter (a : ℝ) (l l' : filter ℝ)` to avoid code duplication. This typeclass combines four
assumptions:

- `pure a ≤ l`;
- `l' ≤ 𝓝 a`;
- `l'` has a basis of measurable sets;
- if `u n` and `v n` tend to `l`, then for any `s ∈ l'`, `Ioc (u n) (v n)` is eventually included
  in `s`.

This typeclass has the following “real” instances: `(a, pure a, ⊥)`, `(a, 𝓝[≥] a, 𝓝[>] a)`,
`(a, 𝓝[≤] a, 𝓝[≤] a)`, `(a, 𝓝 a, 𝓝 a)`.
Furthermore, we have the following instances that are equal to the previously mentioned instances:
`(a, 𝓝[{a}] a, ⊥)` and `(a, 𝓝[univ] a, 𝓝[univ] a)`.
While the difference between `Ici a` and `Ioi a` doesn't matter for theorems about Lebesgue measure,
it becomes important in the versions of FTC about any locally finite measure if this measure has an
atom at one of the endpoints.

### Combining one-sided and two-sided derivatives

There are some `FTC_filter` instances where the fact that it is one-sided or
two-sided depends on the point, namely `(x, 𝓝[Icc a b] x, 𝓝[Icc a b] x)`
(resp. `(x, 𝓝[[a, b]] x, 𝓝[[a, b]] x)`, where `[a, b] = set.uIcc a b`),
with `x ∈ Icc a b` (resp. `x ∈ [a, b]`).
This results in a two-sided derivatives for `x ∈ Ioo a b` and one-sided derivatives for
`x ∈ {a, b}`. Other instances could be added when needed (in that case, one also needs to add
instances for `filter.is_measurably_generated` and `filter.tendsto_Ixx_class`).

### Fundamental theorem of calculus, part 1, for any measure

In this section we prove a few lemmas that can be seen as versions of FTC-1 for interval integrals
w.r.t. any measure. Many theorems are formulated for one or two pairs of filters related by
`FTC_filter a l l'`. This typeclass has exactly four “real” instances: `(a, pure a, ⊥)`,
`(a, 𝓝[≥] a, 𝓝[>] a)`, `(a, 𝓝[≤] a, 𝓝[≤] a)`, `(a, 𝓝 a, 𝓝 a)`, and two instances
that are equal to the first and last “real” instances: `(a, 𝓝[{a}] a, ⊥)` and
`(a, 𝓝[univ] a, 𝓝[univ] a)`.  We use this approach to avoid repeating arguments in many very similar
cases.  Lean can automatically find both `a` and `l'` based on `l`.

The most general theorem `measure_integral_sub_integral_sub_linear_is_o_of_tendsto_ae` can be seen
as a generalization of lemma `integral_has_strict_fderiv_at` below which states strict
differentiability of `∫ x in u..v, f x` in `(u, v)` at `(a, b)` for a measurable function `f` that
is integrable on `a..b` and is continuous at `a` and `b`. The lemma is generalized in three
directions: first, `measure_integral_sub_integral_sub_linear_is_o_of_tendsto_ae` deals with any
locally finite measure `μ`; second, it works for one-sided limits/derivatives; third, it assumes
only that `f` has finite limits almost surely at `a` and `b`.

Namely, let `f` be a measurable function integrable on `a..b`. Let `(la, la')` be a pair of
`FTC_filter`s around `a`; let `(lb, lb')` be a pair of `FTC_filter`s around `b`. Suppose that `f`
has finite limits `ca` and `cb` at `la' ⊓ μ.ae` and `lb' ⊓ μ.ae`, respectively.  Then
`∫ x in va..vb, f x ∂μ - ∫ x in ua..ub, f x ∂μ = ∫ x in ub..vb, cb ∂μ - ∫ x in ua..va, ca ∂μ +
  o(‖∫ x in ua..va, (1:ℝ) ∂μ‖ + ‖∫ x in ub..vb, (1:ℝ) ∂μ‖)`
as `ua` and `va` tend to `la` while `ub` and `vb` tend to `lb`.

This theorem is formulated with integral of constants instead of measures in the right hand sides
for two reasons: first, this way we avoid `min`/`max` in the statements; second, often it is
possible to write better `simp` lemmas for these integrals, see `integral_const` and
`integral_const_of_cdf`.

In the next subsection we apply this theorem to prove various theorems about differentiability
of the integral w.r.t. Lebesgue measure. -/

### Fundamental theorem of calculus-1 for Lebesgue measure

In this section we restate theorems from the previous section for Lebesgue measure.
In particular, we prove that `∫ x in u..v, f x` is strictly differentiable in `(u, v)`
at `(a, b)` provided that `f` is integrable on `a..b` and is continuous at `a` and `b`.

#### Auxiliary `is_o` statements

In this section we prove several lemmas that can be interpreted as strict differentiability of
`(u, v) ↦ ∫ x in u..v, f x ∂μ` in `u` and/or `v` at a filter. The statements use `is_o` because
we have no definition of `has_strict_(f)deriv_at_filter` in the library.

### Fundamental theorem of calculus, part 2

This section contains theorems pertaining to FTC-2 for interval integrals, i.e., the assertion
that `∫ x in a..b, f' x = f b - f a` under suitable assumptions.

The most classical version of this theorem assumes that `f'` is continuous. However, this is
unnecessarily strong: the result holds if `f'` is just integrable. We prove the strong version,
following [Rudin, *Real and Complex Analysis* (Theorem 7.21)][rudin2006real]. The proof is first
given for real-valued functions, and then deduced for functions with a general target space. For
a real-valued function `g`, it suffices to show that `g b - g a ≤ (∫ x in a..b, g' x) + ε` for all
positive `ε`. To prove this, choose a lower-semicontinuous function `G'` with `g' < G'` and with
integral close to that of `g'` (its existence is guaranteed by the Vitali-Carathéodory theorem).
It satisfies `g t - g a ≤ ∫ x in a..t, G' x` for all `t ∈ [a, b]`: this inequality holds at `a`,
and if it holds at `t` then it holds for `u` close to `t` on its right, as the left hand side
increases by `g u - g t ∼ (u -t) g' t`, while the right hand side increases by
`∫ x in t..u, G' x` which is roughly at least `∫ x in t..u, G' t = (u - t) G' t`, by lower
semicontinuity. As  `g' t < G' t`, this gives the conclusion. One can therefore push progressively
this inequality to the right until the point `b`, where it gives the desired conclusion.

Change of variables for continuous integrands. If `f` is continuous on `[a, b]` and has
continuous right-derivative `f'` in `(a, b)`, and `g` is continuous on `f '' [a, b]` then we can
substitute `u = f x` to get `∫ x in a..b, (g ∘ f) x * f' x = ∫ u in f a..f b, g u`.

Change of variables. If `f` is has continuous derivative `f'` on `[a, b]`,
and `g` is continuous on `f '' [a, b]`, then we can substitute `u = f x` to get
`∫ x in a..b, (g ∘ f) x * f' x = ∫ u in f a..f b, g u`.
Compared to `interval_integral.integral_comp_mul_deriv` we only require that `g` is continuous on
`f '' [a, b]`.

Change of variables, most common version. If `f` is has continuous derivative `f'` on `[a, b]`,
and `g` is continuous, then we can substitute `u = f x` to get
`∫ x in a..b, (g ∘ f) x * f' x = ∫ u in f a..f b, g u`.
