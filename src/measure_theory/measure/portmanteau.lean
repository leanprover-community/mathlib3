# Characterizations of weak convergence of finite measures and probability measures

This file will provide portmanteau characterizations of the weak convergence of finite measures
and of probability measures, i.e., the standard characterizations of convergence in distribution.

## Main definitions

This file does not introduce substantial new definitions: the topologies of weak convergence on
the types of finite measures and probability measures are already defined in their corresponding
files.

## Main results

The main result will be the portmanteau theorem providing various characterizations of the
weak convergence of measures. The separate implications are:
 * `measure_theory.finite_measure.limsup_measure_closed_le_of_tendsto` proves that weak convergence
   implies a limsup-condition for closed sets.
 * `measure_theory.limsup_measure_closed_le_iff_liminf_measure_open_ge` proves for probability
   measures the equivalence of the limsup condition for closed sets and the liminf condition for
   open sets.
 * `measure_theory.tendsto_measure_of_null_frontier` proves that the liminf condition for open
   sets (which is equivalent to the limsup condition for closed sets) implies the convergence of
   probabilities of sets whose boundary carries no mass under the limit measure.
 * `measure_theory.probability_measure.tendsto_measure_of_null_frontier_of_tendsto` is a
   combination of earlier implications, which shows that weak convergence of probability measures
   implies the convergence of probabilities of sets whose boundary carries no mass under the
   limit measure.

TODO:
 * Prove the rest of the implications.

## Implementation notes

Many of the characterizations of weak convergence hold for finite measures and are proven in that
generality and then specialized to probability measures. Some implications hold with slightly
weaker assumptions than usually stated. The full portmanteau theorem, however, is most convenient
for probability measures on metrizable spaces with their Borel sigmas.

Some specific considerations on the assumptions in the different implications:
 * `measure_theory.finite_measure.limsup_measure_closed_le_of_tendsto` assumes
   `pseudo_emetric_space`. The only reason is to have bounded continuous pointwise approximations
   to the indicator function of a closed set. Clearly for example metrizability or
   pseudo-emetrizability would be sufficient assumptions. The typeclass assumptions should be later
   adjusted in a way that takes into account use cases, but the proof will presumably remain
   essentially the same.
 * Where formulations are currently only provided for probability measures, one can obtain the
   finite measure formulations using the characterization of convergence of finite measures by
   their total masses and their probability-normalized versions, i.e., by
   `measure_theory.finite_measure.tendsto_normalize_iff_tendsto`.

/-! ### Portmanteau: limsup condition for closed sets iff liminf condition for open sets

In this section we prove that for a sequence of Borel probability measures on a topological space
and its candidate limit measure, the following two conditions are equivalent:
  (C) For any closed set `F` in `Ω` the limsup of the measures of `F` is at most the limit
      measure of `F`.
  (O) For any open set `G` in `Ω` the liminf of the measures of `G` is at least the limit
      measure of `G`.
Either of these will later be shown to be equivalent to the weak convergence of the sequence
of measures.

/-! ### Portmanteau implication: weak convergence implies a limsup condition for closed sets

In this section we prove, under the assumption that the underlying topological space `Ω` is
pseudo-emetrizable, that the weak convergence of measures on `measure_theory.finite_measure Ω`
implies that for any closed set `F` in `Ω` the limsup of the measures of `F` is at most the
limit measure of `F`. This is one implication of the portmanteau theorem characterizing weak
convergence of measures.

Combining with an earlier implication we also get that weak convergence implies that for any Borel
set `E` in `Ω` whose boundary `∂E` carries no mass under the limit measure, the limit of measures
of `E` is the measure of `E` under the limit measure.
