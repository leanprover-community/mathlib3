# Antichains
Investigating the structure of finsets in a partial order.
We define antichains.

## Main definitions
* `antichain` is a finset of elements in a partial order where
  no element is strictly less than another.

* The `join` of two finsets is the set obtained by taking
  their union and removing all elements that are less than
  another element.

* The `meet` of two finsets is their intersection.

A set of elements of a partial order forms an antichain if no two elements
`A` and `B` are ordered `A < B`.

The join of two finsets `A` and `B` is the set obtained by taking
the union of `A` and `B` and removing all elements `a` that are
less than some element `b`. This results in an antichain.

def antichain.join (A B : finset α):
  finset α := (A ∪ B).filter (λ a, a ∈ A ∪ B ∧ ∀ b ∈ A ∪ B, a ≤ b → a = b)

The meet of two finsets `A` and `B` is the set obtained by taking
the intersection of `A` and `B` and removing all elements `a` that are
less than some element `b`. This results in an antichain.
