# Directed indexed families and sets

This file defines directed indexed families and directed sets. An indexed family/set is
directed iff each pair of elements has a shared upper bound.

## Main declarations

* `directed r f`: Predicate stating that the indexed family `f` is `r`-directed.
* `directed_on r s`: Predicate stating that the set `s` is `r`-directed.
* `directed_order α`: Typeclass extending `preorder` for stating that `α` is `≤`-directed.
