# Topological space structure on the opposite monoid and on the units group

In this file we define `topological_space` structure on `Mᵐᵒᵖ`, `Mᵃᵒᵖ`, `Mˣ`, and `add_units M`.
This file does not import definitions of a topological monoid and/or a continuous multiplicative
action, so we postpone the proofs of `has_continuous_mul Mᵐᵒᵖ` etc till we have these definitions.
