### Weak star topology on duals of topological modules
In this section, we define the weak-* topology on duals of suitable topological modules `E` over
suitable topological semirings `𝕜`. The (weak) dual consists of continuous linear functionals
`E →L[𝕜] 𝕜` from `E` to scalars `𝕜`. The weak-* topology is the coarsest topology on this dual
`weak_dual 𝕜 E := (E →L[𝕜] 𝕜)` w.r.t. which the evaluation maps at all `z : E` are continuous.

The weak dual is a module over `𝕜` if the semiring `𝕜` is commutative.
