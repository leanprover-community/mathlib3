# Baire theorem

In a complete metric space, a countable intersection of dense open subsets is dense.

The good concept underlying the theorem is that of a Gδ set, i.e., a countable intersection
of open sets. Then Baire theorem can also be formulated as the fact that a countable
intersection of dense Gδ sets is a dense Gδ set. We prove Baire theorem, giving several different
formulations that can be handy. We also prove the important consequence that, if the space is
covered by a countable union of closed sets, then the union of their interiors is dense.

The names of the theorems do not contain the string "Baire", but are instead built from the form of
the statement. "Baire" is however in the docstring of all the theorems, to facilitate grep searches.

We also define the filter `residual α` generated by dense `Gδ` sets and prove that this filter
has the countable intersection property.
