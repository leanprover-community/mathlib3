# The completion of a metric space

Completion of uniform spaces are already defined in `topology.uniform_space.completion`. We show
here that the uniform space completion of a metric space inherits a metric space structure,
by extending the distance to the completion and checking that it is indeed a distance, and that
it defines the same uniformity as the already defined uniform structure on the completion
