Extended metric spaces.

Authors: Jeremy Avigad, Robert Y. Lewis, Johannes Hölzl, Mario Carneiro, Sébastien Gouëzel

This file is devoted to the definition and study of `emetric_spaces`, i.e., metric
spaces in which the distance is allowed to take the value ∞. This extended distance is
called `edist`, and takes values in `ennreal`.

Many definitions and theorems expected on emetric spaces are already introduced on uniform spaces and
topological spaces. For example:
  open and closed sets, compactness, completeness, continuity and uniform continuity

The class `emetric_space` therefore extends `uniform_space` (and `topological_space`).

/- Design note: one could define an `emetric_space` just by giving `edist`, and then
derive an instance of `uniform_space` by taking the natural uniform structure
associated to the distance. This creates diamonds problem for products, as the
uniform structure on the product of two emetric spaces could be obtained first
by obtaining two uniform spaces and then taking their products, or by taking
the product of the emetric spaces and then the associated uniform structure.
The two uniform structure we have just described are equal, but not defeq, which
creates a lot of problem.

The idea is to add, in the very definition of an `emetric_space`, a uniform structure
with a uniformity which equal to the one given by the distance, but maybe not defeq.
And the instance from `emetric_space` to `uniform_space` uses this uniformity.
In this way, when we create the product of emetric spaces, we put in the product
the uniformity corresponding to the product of the uniformities. There is one more
proof obligation, that this product uniformity is equal to the uniformity corresponding
to the product metric. But the diamond problem disappears.

The same trick is used in the definition of a metric space, where one stores as well
a uniform structure and an edistance. -/

/-- Extended metric spaces, with an extended distance `edist` possibly taking the
value ∞

Each emetric space induces a canonical `uniform_space` and hence a canonical `topological_space`.
This is enforced in the type class definition, by extending the `uniform_space` structure. When
instantiating an `emetric_space` structure, the uniformity fields are not necessary, they will be
filled in by default. There is a default value for the uniformity, that can be substituted
in cases of interest, for instance when instantiating an `emetric_space` structure
on a product.

Continuity of `edist` is finally proving in `topology.instances.ennreal`
